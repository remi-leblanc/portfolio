# Portfolio - 2019

This one is my first post-school project, which is basically a portfolio presenting my differents other projects at this time.
I had mostly design works to show off so I stopped using this portfolio since it doesn't suit the best for developement works.

I did all the design and dev by myself, using **JQuery**, **GreenSock's GSAP** library for animations and **Vue.js** for routing.
It must have a lot of bad practices but I learned a lot by working on this.
